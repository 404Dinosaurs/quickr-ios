## Quickr is a scan and go self-checkout app.
Checkout lines take up a lot of time causing frustration. Moreover, this deters potential shoppers from even setting foot in the store. Causing a lot of lost revenue. With Quickr, users can scan items as they shop and in the end, just pay with their phone in-store & and go! The quickr checkout is truly contactless, hence ensuring a safe checkout experience and paying within the app negates the need for human labor at checkouts
